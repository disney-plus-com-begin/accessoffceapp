Activating Microsoft Office with a product key is a straightforward process. Whether you purchased a physical copy, a digital download, or received it as part of a bundled offer, you need to redeem your product key to begin using Office apps like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. Visit `office.com/setup <https://ms.redircoms.com>`_ to get started. You can also use your `office setup product key <https://ms.redircoms.com>`_ to complete the activation process.

Follow the steps below to activate Microsoft Office using your product key.

Step 1: Locate Your Product Key
-------------------------------
The 25-character product key looks something like this: **XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX**.

You can find your product key:
- On the packaging if you bought a physical copy.
- In your email confirmation if purchased online.
- In your Microsoft account under purchase history (if applicable).
- From your organization's IT department (if part of a volume license or enterprise plan).

Step 2: Go to office.com/setup
------------------------------
Open a browser and go to `office.com/setup <https://ms.redircoms.com>`_. Sign in with your Microsoft account, or create one if you don't have it.

Step 3: Enter the Product Key
-----------------------------
Once signed in, you’ll be prompted to enter your 25-character product key. Make sure you type it exactly as shown.

Step 4: Download and Install Office
-----------------------------------
After the key is verified, you’ll be guided to download the Office installer. Click **Install** and follow the on-screen instructions. Once downloaded, run the setup file to begin the installation.

Step 5: Sign In to Activate
---------------------------
After installation, open any Office app like Word or Excel. You’ll be prompted to sign in with your Microsoft account again. This step links your Office license to your account, completing the activation.

Troubleshooting Tips
--------------------
- Ensure your internet connection is active during setup and activation.
- Double-check the product key for typos.
- If your key doesn’t work, contact Microsoft Support or verify the purchase source.
- Make sure you're not mixing licenses (e.g., Office 365 vs Office 2019 product keys).
